# Exercises in SSJS (Server-Side JavaScript) for SFMC

## Exercise 1:
Given this DataSet generate an SSJS to:

- Review record by record and create a Data Extension if there is an interest that does not have a Data Extension.
- It must distribute each record in its corresponding Data Extension and not duplicate records have a log that indicates that the review starts and ends and if it creates a Data Extension on what date it has done it.

BE CAREFUL WITH THE RETRIEVE THAT ONLY BRINGS A MAXIMUM OF 2500 RECORDS


## Exercise 2:

An automatism with a ssjs that deletes all records that have no interest. In this case, unlike the previous one, you can use queries.
